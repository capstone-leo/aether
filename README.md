- An audio-Visual Music Collaboration Experience Our goal is to create a loosely
  structured audio visual “jam” space for users to compose and visualize music with a
  variety of instruments collaboratively in a live session. When collaborative art
  cannot be made in-person, this application brings people together in a creative
  environment. This audio visual “jam” space serves as a tool to compose and visualize
  music with a variety of instruments in a live 3-D session.
